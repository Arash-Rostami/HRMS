                that you think needs a change or an improvement in this year. From very, very small things to really big
                things, all of which are important. With this, you can increase productivity, reduce costs, get rid of
                bad habits (from consumption patterns of food, water, electricity and energy to group behavior and other
                things), reduce paperwork or administrative problems, and improve safety and environmental conditions.
                Overall, you can appear influential by speaking your mind.
